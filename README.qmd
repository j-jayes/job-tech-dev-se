## Purpose

This repo contains a one percent sample of the enriched jobtech data from [jobtechdev.se](https://jobtechdev.se/sv).

They provide a one percent sample from 2016 to 2022Q2 to help you get to grips with the data.

I have ingested this from the seven `.jsonl` files and saved it as two `.csv` files.

You can download the first and second files [here](data/job_tech_data_pt_1.csv) and [here](data/job_tech_data_pt_2.csv), respectively.
